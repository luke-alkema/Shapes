The {\bfseries{Shapes}} Project is meant to be a firt look at inheritance in the world of OOP. Aiming to model a \doxylink{class_shape}{Shape} class at its most basic elements, to be inherited from by more specified Shapes like a \doxylink{class_circle}{Circle} or \doxylink{class_square}{Square}. It shows a simple yet intutive relationship of classes allowing for the development of some true virtual functions in the \doxylink{class_shape}{Shape} class, that get implemented in its child-\/classes. The \doxylink{class_shape}{Shape} class holds many oppourtunites to be used to create a variety of Shapes. These classes relate to eachother because they are Shapes, which is modeled by the \doxylink{class_shape}{Shape} class. Its attributes are name of shape and colour of shape thing\textquotesingle{}s that every shape has, it also covers the case of unknown or undefiend names and colours. As well as some behaviors implemented as pure virtual functions to be overridden by child classes to calculate their permieter, area, or trait-\/dimesnions (hypotenuse, diameter, side length). So far there are 2 child classes that make use of these virtual functions, \doxylink{class_circle}{Circle} and Square! Which both use their signyfying trait to calculate each one of those values. The circle and square class both have their own values such as radius and side length to model their respective shapes. As well as their own behaviors like showing information and the virtual functions mentioned above. You can also use various overloaded operators in the specific shapes.\hypertarget{index_Shape}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Shape}{Shape}}\label{index_Shape}
The {\bfseries{\doxylink{class_shape}{Shape}{\bfseries{ class is the base class for every possible shape. How is this possible? Well, because the only attributes in this class are colour and the name of the shape (e.\+g. Triangle). Besides the getters and setters for these attributes, there are 3 pure virtual functions in this class. This is becuase for every class that inherits from it, we want to force them to include functions to calculate the perimeter, area, and overall dimension. We hope you enjoy this wonderful class. You are in for quite the experience, so buckle up!}}}}
