The {\bfseries{Test\+Dog}} application is meant to show how {\itshape constructors} and {\itshape destructors} are used and/or called within an OO application. As well, this program is one of the first OO applications that OOP students have seen (in terms of the source code) so it also serves as a example of {\itshape programming style} and {\itshape DOxygen commenting style})

Major DOxygen features to note are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the Project / Application description and documentation found in the {\bfseries{Main Page}}
\item how {\bfseries{classes}} are commented using DOxygen
\item how {\bfseries{methods}} are commented using DOxygen
\item the fact that you can still comment your source code (in C or C++ style) and have DOxygen ignore those comments while constructing your Project documentation
\end{DoxyItemize}

That list of major DOxygen features (this time in a numbered list) are\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item the Project / Application description and documentation found in the {\bfseries{Main Page}}
\item how {\bfseries{classes}} are commented using DOxygen
\item how {\bfseries{methods}} are commented using DOxygen
\item the fact that you can still comment your source code (in C or C++ style) and have DOxygen ignore those comments while constructing your Project documentation
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

If your project and/or documentation requires a link to some external link -\/ you can easily include those in your DOxygen comments like this \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://www.kwhumane.com/}{\texttt{ The K-\/W Humane Society}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

If using the code in this package as an example -\/ please modify the comments as appropriate for your own specific code.

If you are tracking the versioning of your project software (as you would in the real world) then this is a good place to indicate (on a per version basis)\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item features added to the software
\item incidents / bugs / issues fixed
\item etc.
\end{DoxyItemize}

I can include the contents of TEXT files {\itshape as is} directly into the DOxygen comments

 \hypertarget{index_requirements}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Project Requirements}{Project Requirements}}\label{index_requirements}
I can include the contents of an HTML version of the {\itshape Requirements Document} directly into the DOxygen comments -\/ in BLOCKQUOTE style \begin{quote}
 \end{quote}


If you also want to include some (or all) of the Project\textquotesingle{}s requirements in your DOxygen documentation -\/ you could use this space to do so.

{\itshape Please Note \+: The requirement(s) summary doesn\textquotesingle{}t have to be an SRS by any means ... \DoxyHorRuler{0}
