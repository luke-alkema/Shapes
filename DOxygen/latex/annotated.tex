Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_circle}{Circle}} \\*The purpose of the \doxylink{class_circle}{Circle} class is to extend from the \doxylink{class_shape}{Shape} class and further model a \doxylink{class_circle}{Circle} }{\pageref{class_circle}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_shape}{Shape}} \\*The purpose of the \doxylink{class_shape}{Shape} class is to model a shape to its most abstract level, its name and its colour. So specialized child classes to inherit from here }{\pageref{class_shape}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_square}{Square}} \\*The purpose of the \doxylink{class_square}{Square} class is to extend from the \doxylink{class_shape}{Shape} class and further model a \doxylink{class_square}{Square} }{\pageref{class_square}}{}
