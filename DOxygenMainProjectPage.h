/// \section intro Program Introduction
/// The <b>TestDog</b> application is meant to show how <i>constructors</i> and
/// <i>destructors</i> are used and/or called within an OO application.  As well, 
/// this program is one of the first OO applications that OOP students have seen 
/// (in terms of the source code) so it also serves as a example of <i>programming style</i> and 
/// <i>DOxygen commenting style</i>) 
///
///
/// Major DOxygen features to note are:
/// 
/// - the Project / Application description and documentation found in the <b>Main Page</b> 
/// - how <b>classes</b> are commented using DOxygen
/// - how <b>methods</b> are commented using DOxygen
/// - the fact that you can still comment your source code (in C or C++ style) and have DOxygen ignore those comments while constructing your Project documentation
///
///
/// That list of major DOxygen features (this time in a numbered list) are:
/// -# the Project / Application description and documentation found in the <b>Main Page</b> 
/// -# how <b>classes</b> are commented using DOxygen
/// -# how <b>methods</b> are commented using DOxygen
/// -# the fact that you can still comment your source code (in C or C++ style) and have DOxygen ignore those comments while constructing your Project documentation
///
///
/// If your project and/or documentation requires a link to some external link - you can easily include those in your DOxygen 
/// comments like this :
/// - <A target=blank HREF="http://www.kwhumane.com/"> The K-W Humane Society</A>
///
///
/// If using the code in this package as an example - please modify the comments
/// as appropriate for your own specific code.
